# carousel-spec.md template

Write this to `instagram-carousel/<topic-slug>/spec/carousel-spec.md`. It is the **contract** the
generate skill renders. The user may edit any field directly before generating.

Use this exact structure (YAML-ish front block + one `## Slide N` block each + a caption block).

**Lead every `## Slide N` with a wireframe** — a small ASCII mock showing where each element lands on
the 1080×1350 canvas (badge → headline → subhead → ≤3 bullets → the Clawd/world → logo · tail ·
@handle). It lets the user *see* each slide like a layout mock before any image is rendered. The
renderer ignores it and draws from the `- key: value` fields beneath it — so keep wireframe lines
starting with `│`, `┌`, `└`, spaces, or `•` (never `#` or `- `, which would confuse the parser):

  5 repos that do the boilerplate for you 👇
  I cloned these so you don't have to rebuild auth, tests, and CI from zero.
  #2 saved me a full day this week.
  Comment REPOS and I'll DM you all five.

## Rules for filling it
- `handle` + `accent_default`: read from `BRAND.md` at the project root (ships as `@erictechpro` /
  `#2BAADF`). The `handle` is the real **Instagram account username** the deck posts from; it gets
  lettered into every slide, so it must be identical across all slides and confirmed before rendering.
  Never invent a handle or accent — if `BRAND.md` is missing, ask the user once.
- `logo_file` + `accent_hex`: look up the featured tool in
  `../instagram-carousel-generate/references/tool-brand-colors.md`. Fall back to the BRAND.md
  `default_accent` if the tool has none.
- Respect density caps (headline ≤7 words, ≤3 bullets ≤6 words). **Generate renders the whole slide
  — text included — via GPT Image 2**, so keep each slide to ONE big idea with minimal copy and a
  punchy headline; it has to stop a scroll.
- Every slide gets a **vivid `character_pose` — it becomes the actual rendered scene**, so make it
  specific to that slide's idea. The topic is fanning out many agents, so visualize it: a master
  orchestrating a crowd of agent-Clawds, finder/refuter pairs, a search fan-out, an agent per
  document. (`card_style` is just a hint.)
- `terminal: "<command>"` renders as a **Claude Code CLI window** (dots + Claude logo + the command +
  an "Opus 4.8" status bar). Use it on workflow/command slides; keep the command short.
- Leave `mimic_ui: none` unless the research flagged a worth-showing source UI.
- Run the anti-AI scrub on every text field before saving.
